		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p>This document serves as user manual for the <strong>aniGen</strong> editor, version 0.7.3.
		The manual describes the interface, controls and files, provides a basic explanation of SVG animation, and a set of examples which can serve as basic tutorials.</p>
		
		<section id="introduction_editor">
			<h2>About editor</h2>
			<p><strong>AniGen</strong> is a browser-based SVG animation editor. It is designed to work in tandem with <a href="http://inkscape.org">Inkscape</a>, expanding its functionality
			to allow the user to animate vector images, as well as export them. Transfer of files between the editors should work without loss of information.</p>
			<p>AniGen is free software available as is. It is written and maintained by Ond≈ôej 'Aibo' Benda, and covered by GPLv3 license. The editor is currently in testing phase. Please take a moment to encounter any <a href="#bugs">bugs</a> you encounter.</p>
			<p>For more information about SVG format, see the format's <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/Overview.html">specification</a>.</p>
		</section>
		
		<section id="introduction_compatibility">
			<h2>Compatibility</h2>
			<p>The editor is developed mainly on <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome">Google Chrome</a>, and should also work reasonably well on <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Mozilla Firefox</a>.
			Compatibility with other browsers is not the editor's main objective. To use the editor, JavaScript needs to be enabled.</p>

		<h1>User interface</h1>
		<img src="_images/editor_overview.png" alt="Overview of the aniGen editor's main window.">
		<p>The main window of aniGen (shown above) consists of seven main sections:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Main menu</strong></li> 
				<li><strong>Global information</strong></li> 
				<li><strong>Selection information</strong></li> 
				<li><strong>Toolbar</strong></li> 
				<li><strong>Canvas</strong></li> 
				<li><strong>XML editor</strong></li> 
				<li><strong>Windows</strong></li> 
			</ul>
		<p>The XML editor and windows are toggled by the icons on right side of toolbar.</p>
		
		<section id="interface_menu">
			<h2>Main menu</h2>
			<p>The menu (top right corner) allows access to most of the editor's functions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>File</strong>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Open</strong> - shows file open dialogue, which allows you to open a new SVG file (see <a href="#files_opening">file opening</a>).</li> 
						<li><strong>Save and download</strong> (ctrl+s) - saves the current SVG document and downloads it. Due to limitations of web storage, the editor does not save automatically.</li>
						<li><strong>Export</strong> (ctrl+shift+e) - opens the export dialogue, allowing you to export the current SVG as an archived series of PNG images (see <a href="#files_exporting">file exporting</a>).</li>
					</ul>
				</li> 
				<li><strong>Global information</strong>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Undo</strong> (ctrl+z) - reverts last step in history.</li> 
						<li><strong>Redo</strong> (ctrl+shift+z) - repeats last undone step in history.</li> 
						<li><strong>Cut</strong> (ctrl+x) - removes currently selected element from the document, placing it in the <em>clipboard</em>.</li> 
						<li><strong>Paste</strong> (ctrl+v) - depends on the nature of element in <em>clipboard</em> and the current selection:
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Visual element &rarr; container element</strong> - places a copy of the element into the container (e.g. pasting a path into a group)</li>
								<li><strong>Visual element &rarr; visual element</strong> - places a copy of the element into the other element's parent (e.g. pasting a rectangle over an ellipse)</li>
								<li><strong>Animation &rarr; generic element</strong> - places a copy of the animation into the selected element</li>
								<li><strong>Animation &rarr; animation</strong> - copies timing information from clipboard animation into the selected animation. This includes keyframes, begins, duration, 
									calculation mode, and splines (if applicable). If selected animation has more keyframes than the animation in clipboard, last keyframes are removed. If it has fewer keyframes, the last
									are duplicated.</li>
							</ul>
						</li> 
						<li><strong>Copy</strong> (ctrl+c) - places a copy of currently selected element into the <em>clipboard</em>.</li>
						<li><strong>Duplicate</strong> (ctrl+d) - creates a copy of currently selected element over it.</li>
						<li><strong>Delete</strong> (delete) - removes currently selected element from the document.</li>
					</ul>
				</li> 
				<li><strong>Object</strong>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Group</strong> (ctrl+g) - places the current selection into a group.</li> 
						<li><strong>Ungroup</strong> (ctrl+alt+g) - removes the currently selected group, placing its child elements into its parent.</li> 
						<li><strong>Object to animation state</strong> - opens the animation state dialogue (see <a href="#animation_groups">animated groups</a>).</li>
						<li><strong>Create new animated group</strong> - allows the creation of animated group from previously saved states (see <a href="#animation_groups">animated groups</a>).</li>
						<li><strong>Manage animation states</strong> - opens dialogue with existing animation state groups and their given states (see <a href="#animation_groups">animated groups</a>).</li>
					</ul>
				</li> 
				<li><strong>Animation</strong>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Translate</strong> - adds translation animation to the selected element (see <a href="#animation_types_transform_translate">translation</a>).</li> 
						<li><strong>Move through path</strong> - adds motion animation to the selected element (see <a href="#animation_types_motion">motion through path</a>).</li> 
						<li><strong>Rotate</strong> - adds rotation animation to the selected element (see <a href="#animation_types_transform_rotate">rotation</a>).</li> 
						<li><strong>Scale</strong> - adds scaling animation to the selected element (see <a href="#animation_types_transform_scale">scaling</a>).</li> 
						<li><strong>Scale horizontally</strong> - adds horizontal skewing animation to the selected element (see <a href="#animation_types_transform_skew">skewing</a>).</li> 
						<li><strong>Scale vertically</strong> - adds vertical skewing animation to the selected element (see <a href="#animation_types_transform_skew">skewing</a>).</li>

				Leaf elements (i.e. elements with no children) can be selected by single click.</p>
			<p>XML editor is useful for quick navigation between elements, as well as selecting animations, which have no direct graphical representation to click.</p>
			<p>Elements are shown (from top to bottom) in order of <em>rendering</em>, meaning the lowest elements will be on top of the drawing.</p>

		<section id="interface_keyframes">
			<h2>Keyframes and timing</h2>
			<p><img src="_images/window_keyframes1.png" alt="Keyframes window">Keyframes window shows the <a href="#animation_keyframes">keyframes</a> and <a href="#animation_timing">timing</a> of currently selected animation.
				(See <a href="#animation">animation</a> for more details.)</p>
			<p>While details may vary, each keyframe generally has a percentage (its position relative to the duration of the animation), time (the same, as time relative to the animation's beginning) and one or more values.
				Animations with the <em>spline</em> <a href="#animation_timing_interpolation">interpolation mode</a> also show the respective <a href="#animation_timing_splines">splines</a> between every pair of keyframes.
				Splines can be changed between various presets or a custom value can be given instead.</p>
			<p>Clicking the percent or time value allows you to change it, with certain restrictions. First (0%) and last (100%) keyframes' times cannot be changed. Keyframes between any other two can only be changed in the interval between their
				neighbours (e.g. the selected keyframe can only be set between 0% and 50%, or 0 and 5 seconds respecively).</p>
			<p>Keyframes can be selected by clicking the striped button on the left. To select multiple frames, hold ctrl. Holding shift will select all frames between the furthest already selected frame and the frame clicked.</p>
			<p>Values can be changed with standard input fields. If multiple keyframes are selected, all of their values are changed when you change one. It's also possible to drag the keyframes to switch their values with one another, 
				or move them up and down with <em>page up</em> / <em>page down</em>. Selected keyframes can be duplicated with <em>ctrl+d</em> and deleted with <em>delete</em>.</p>
			<p>Selected keyframes are affected by the context menu (right click). If none is selected, the clicked keyframe is affected, except the cases noted below.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><img src="_png/ui/20/arrow-up-white.png" alt="Move keyframe up button"><strong>Move up</strong> - moves the keyframe's values and spline (if applicable) up.</li>
				<li><img src="_png/ui/20/plus-white.png" alt="Duplicate keyframe button"><strong>Duplicate</strong> - creates copy of keyframe(s)</li>
				<li><img src="_png/ui/20/arrow-down-white.png" alt="Lower layer button"><strong>Move down</strong> - moves keyframe(s) down</li>
				
				<li><img src="_png/ui/20/clock-black.png" alt="Balance keyframes button"><strong>Balance keyframes</strong> - sets the selected keyframes in even intervals between one another. First and last keyframes of each block of selected frames are not affected. If no frames are selected, all keyframes are affected instead.</li>
				<li><img src="_png/ui/20/arrow-double-horizontal-black.png" alt="Invert values button"><strong>Invert values</strong> (when applicable) - inverts the values of selected keyframes. If no keyframes are selected, all are affected. Inversion is applicable in following cases:
					<ul>
						<li><a href="#animation_types_transform_translate">Translation</a> - X and Y values are multiplied by minus one.</li>
						<li><a href="#animation_types_transform_rotate">Rotation</a> and <a href="#animation_types_transform_skew">skewing</a> - Angle values are multiplied by minus one.</li>
						<li><a href="#animation_types_transform_scale">Scaling</a> - X and Y values inverted (changed to 1/X and 1/Y).</li>
						<li><a href="#animation_types_attribute">Attribute animation</a> - only if the affected attribute is <em>display</em> or <em>visibility</em> - values are changed to their opposites.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li><img src="_png/ui/20/trash-black.png" alt="Remove keyframe button"><strong>Remove keyframes</strong> - deletes selected keyframes (except first and last keyframe).</li>
			</ul>
			<p><img src="_images/window_keyframes2.png" alt="Keyframes window">The second tab of the window shows a list of begin times, that is times when animation will start (see <a href="#animation_timing_duration">duration, repetition, and begins</a> for more details).
				New begins can be added by inputing a time (in seconds) in the field below the list, and selecting "add". Begins are removed by the buttons on their right. The end time given for each begin time is the time when the given set of loops (if applicable) of animation ends -
				if two loops overlap, the animation resets at the later begin value.</p>

			<h2>Importing</h2>
			<p>Files can be imported by dragging them into the editor's canvas. Imported files include SVGs, JPEGs and PNGs. Raster files (JPEGs and PNGs) will be appended to the currently selected container object.
				SVGs will be merged, i.e. all elements container in the root SVG element will be moved to the current SVG's root element, and the contents of <a href="elements_common_defs">defs</a>
				(clip paths, gradients, animation states etc.) will be moved to current defs.</p>
			<p>It's recommended to save file before importing.</p>

		<section id="files_exporting">
			<h2>Exporting</h2>
			<p><img src="_images/dialogue_export1.png" alt="File export dialogue">Current SVG can be exported as a series of PNGs archived in a ZIP.
				The dialogue allows the user to set the beginning of the animation (in seconds), duration of exported animation (in seconds) and the framerate (in frames per second).</p>
			<p><img src="_images/dialogue_export2.png" alt="Rendering in progress">While rendering, the editor will be unavailable. Progress and estimated time to completion (HH:MM:SS) is shown.
				The rendering process can take significant time, which scales with the number of elements in the SVG. Furthermore, each PNG is stored in the computer's memory. It's recommended to export longer animations, 
				or animations with extremely large size, in smaller segments. Rendering process can be canceled (with slight delay).</p>
			<p><img src="_images/dialogue_export3.png" alt="Files being packed into a ZIP">When all frames are rendered, they are packed into a ZIP, which then triggers the standard save dialogue of the browser.
				This process takes some time, but comperatively little to the rendering process.</p>
			<p>Exporting is currently in testing phases. If you enounter problems (such as differences between the SVG's animation and exported frames), see <a href="#bugs">bug reporting</a>.</p>

		<h1>Elements and the XML tree</h1>
			<p>An SVG is an XML format, meaning the file is composed of <em>elements</em>. In code, these usually appear as pairs of <em>tags</em> similar to this:</p>
			<code>
				<span class="b">&lt;svg</span> <span class="r">id</span>=<span class="g">"green"</span><span class="b">&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;</span>
			</code>
			<p>In this example, <em>svg</em> is the element's <em>tag name</em>, <em>id</em> is a name of an attribute (in this case an identifier), and <em>green</em> is this attribute's value. &lt;svg&gt; is the opening tag and &lt;/svg&gt; is the closing tag.</p>
			<p>An element can have various attributes. Some are shared betwen different types of elements, like <em>id</em> or <em>transform</em>, others are exclusive to certain type of element, like <em>dur</em> (animation duration).</p>
			<p>Most elements can have children, that is, other elements between the opening and closing tags.</p>
			<code>
				<span class="b">&lt;svg</span> <span class="r">id</span>=<span class="g">"green"</span><span class="b">&gt;</span><br>
				<span class="b tab">&lt;g</span> <span class="r">id</span>=<span class="g">"group"</span><span class="b">&gt;&lt;/g&gt;</span><br>
				<span class="b">&lt;/svg&gt;</span>
			</code>
			<p>In this case, the <em>g</em> element is a child of the <em>svg</em> element.</p>
			<p>An SVG file will usually have single <em>svg</em> element as its root, and all other elements will be its children, or the children of its children (and so on). This is called "nesting" and creates a tree structure depicted in the <a href="#interface_xml">XML editor</a>.</p>
			<p>All SVGs share these basic properties.</p>
		
		<section id="elements_attributes">
			<h2>Attributes</h2>
				<p>As mentioned above, elements can have various attributes. For example:</p>
				<code>
					<span class="b">&lt;rect</span><br>
					<span class="r tab">id</span>=<span class="g">"rectangle1"</span><br>
					<span class="r tab">x</span>=<span class="g">"10"</span><br>
					<span class="r tab">y</span>=<span class="g">"20"</span><br>
					<span class="r tab">width</span>=<span class="g">"50"</span><br>
					<span class="r tab">height</span>=<span class="g">"100"</span><br>
					<span class="r tab">fill</span>=<span class="g">"red"</span><br>
					<span class="b">&gt;</span><br>
					<span class="b">&lt;/rect&gt;</span>
				</code>
				<p>The code above defines a rectangle (<em>rect</em> element). Its top left corner is denoted by the given x and y attributes, its width and height by attributes of the same name (all sizes default to pixels).
					Furthermore, its fill color is set to "red", equal to the hexadecimal value of #ff0000.</p>
				<p>Were one of the attributes changed, e.g.</p>
				<code>
					<span class="b">&lt;rect</span><br>
					<span class="r tab">id</span>=<span class="g">"rectangle1"</span><br>
					<strong><span class="r tab">x</span>=<span class="g">"50"</span></strong><br>
					<span class="r tab">y</span>=<span class="g">"20"</span><br>
					<span class="r tab">width</span>=<span class="g">"50"</span><br>
					<span class="r tab">height</span>=<span class="g">"100"</span><br>
					<span class="r tab">fill</span>=<span class="g">"red"</span><br>
					<span class="b">&gt;</span><br>
					<span class="b">&lt;/rect&gt;</span>
				</code>
				<p>The element's properties will change. In this case, the top left corner (along with the rest of the element) will move 40 pixels right (along the x axis).</p>
				<p><strong>All</strong> SVG animations work by changing an attribute (or in some cases, CSS styles) over time.</p>
				
				<p>Attributes of interest common to multiple types of elements:</p>
				<table>
					<tr><th>Attribute name</th><th>Description</th><th>Possible values</th></tr>
					<tr><td>transform</td><td>Transformation of given element, usually in the form of a 3x3 matrix (simplified as its first two rows, i.e. six numeric values). Basis of all transformation animations.</td><td>matrix(a b c d e f), rotate(angle cx cy), translate(x y), scale(x y), skewX(angle), skewY(angle)</td></tr>
					<tr><td>id</td><td>Identifier, unique to the SVG file. Other elements can use this to connect to others, for example, in case of gradients.</td><td>string</td></tr>
					<tr><td>style</td><td>CSS styles, providing a large number of various visual options - colors, opacity, stroke width and dashing are all handled by these.</td><td>semicolon separated pairs of name:value</td></tr>
					<tr><td>display</td><td>Whether the element should or should not be displayed. Sometimes as part of CSS styles.</td><td>usually none or inline (none meaning hidden)</td></tr>
					<tr><td>visibility</td><td>Whether the element should or should not be visible, similar to "display". Sometimes as part of CSS styles.</td><td>usually hidden or visible</td></tr>
					<tr><td>opacity</td><td>Opacity (non-transparency) of the given element. Carries over to all of its children.</td><td>numeric value between 0 and 1 (1 meaning 100% opaque)</td></tr>

						<ul>
							<li><strong>width</strong> and <strong>height</strong>, determining the size of the rendered canvas</li>
							<li><strong>viewBox</strong> (x y width height), defining the position and size of rendered rectangular area</li>
						</ul>

					<h3>Group &lt;g&gt;</h2>
						<p>See also <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/struct.html#Groups">W3C recommendation</a>.</p>
						<p>A container element, meaning an element with no actual graphical representation - simply holds other elements.</p>

					<h3>Definitions &lt;defs&gt;</h2>
						<p>See also <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/struct.html#DefsElement">W3C recommendation</a>.</p>
						<p>A special container element, usually placed directly in the root <em>svg</em> element. Holds definitions, which can be various other elements. These are not rendered, but can be linked to by other elements in the SVG file.</p>
						<p>For example, <em>defs</em> element holds the information about all clip paths, masks and filters. In aniGen, animation states are also kept here.</p>

		<h1>Animation</h1>
			<p>All types of SVG animations share some common properties. Each animation has set duration of one pass (with possible repetition), a set of begin times, and keyframes which describe the value at given times, denoted as percentages of the animation's duration.</p>
			<p>Furthermore, animations can be set to hold their last value after they finish (or return to the original value), are able to acumulate (meaning each run of the animation will add to the previous value), and calculate values through different interpolation modes.</p>
			<section id="animation_timing">
				<h2>Timing</h2>
					<section id="animation_timing_duration">
						<h3>Duration</h3>
						<p>All animations have a set duration. This describes how long a <em>single run</em> of the animation lasts. In aniGen, this value is in seconds.</p>
					</section>
					
					<section id="animation_timing_beginnings">
						<h3>Beginnings</h3>
						<p>Any animation can have multiple begin times. At each time, the animation restarts, and if applicable, loops the given number of times. If an animation is set to begin again while it's still running, it will usually reset. AniGen uses values given in seconds of the SVG's time.</p>
					</section>
					
					<section id="animation_timing_beginnings">
						<h3>Repetition</h3>
						<p>An animation can repeat multiple time per each beginning. Repeat count of zero means the animation only runs once, higher values denote multiple repetitions. Furthermore, repetition can be set to "indefinite", meaning the animation will run forever (or until it's ended by external source).</p>
					</section>
					
					<section id="animation_timing_interpolation">
						<h3>Interpolation modes</h3>
						<p>The progress between every pair of values can be calculated in several ways:</p>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>Linear</strong> - meaning a continuous change from one value to the other.</li>
							<li><strong>Discrete</strong> - changing instantaneously (without any interpolation) at the time of the given keyframe.</li>
							<li><strong>Spline</strong> - progress is guided by a simple <em>spline</em>, allowing for non-linear calculation. See <a href="#animation_timing_splines">splines</a>.</li>
							<li><strong>Paced</strong> - animation slows down and speeds up to provide smooth progression between keyframes. Usually only applicable for <a href="animation_types_motion">motion through path</a> - the animation element will slow down during sharp turns, slow down as it nears each keyframe position etc.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					
					<section id="animation_timing_splines">
						<h3>Splines</h3>
						<p>A non-linear way of interpolation between keyframes. Splines are simple curves defined by two control points, each as its X and Y value between 0 and 1.</p>
						<p>AniGen uses several spline presets, but also allows the user to set custom splines more suited to their needs.</p>
						<p>The following examples show simple two-value animation. Top bar progresses according to a spline, bottom bar has linear progression. Spline's shape is depicted in red, its control points are shown as white circles.</p>

					</section>
			</section>
				
			<section id="animation_keyframes">
				<h2>Keyframes</h2>
				<p><img src="_images/window_keyframes1.png" alt="Keyframes window">Each animation has a set of keyframes. Each is denoted by its time (given as percentage of a single animation run) and its value. If <em>spline</em> interpolation mode is selected, every frame (except the first one) will have a spline attached to it as well, describing how the animation progresses to this keyframe from the previous one.</p>
				<p>Format of values is specific to each animation type. In general, each "value" is actually a set of numeric values. As the animation progresses, the value is changed from one to the other according to the selected interpolation mode. For instance, a path animation will calculate the position of each control point of the path at each given time. This limits animations somewhat; an animation with no clear way to change from one value to the next will progress discretely (it will jump). For instance, a path's shape can only change into a shape with the same amount and types of control points. Other attributes, such as visibility, can have non-numeric values (visible/hidden), and can only change discretely.</p>
				<p>Keyframes can be manipulated through the <a href="#interface_keyframes">keyframes and timing</a> window. Motion and transformation animations also have a node-based interface shown on the canvas, and described in sections below.</p>
				<p>Keyframe window allows duplication and deletion of keyframes (with the minimal two keyframes - 0% and 100%). Keyframes can be moved by dragging, efectively switching values (and splines) while retaining timing.</p>
			</section>
		
			<section id="animation_other">
				<h2>Other attributes</h2>
				<p>Animations have several other attributes:</p>
				<p><strong>Post-animation state</strong> (or "fill") describes how animation affects its parent once it finishes. If <em>from animation</em> is selected, it will retain the value of its last keyframe. On the other hand, selecting <em>original</em> will return the affected element to the state it had before the animation.</p>
				<p><strong>Additive</strong> indicates whether animation should add to any previous value the affected element already has or not. For instance, an additive translation from 0 to 100 will move the element from its original position. For non-additive animation, if the element already has a transformation attribute, however, it will be completely replaced. It's recommended to set additive to "yes" for transformations and motion along a path. Attribute animations, in contrast, are usually better served by replacing the attribute completely.</p>
				<p><strong>Cumulative</strong> attribute indicates the animation should add to its own value each time it runs. This means that with each repetition (or new begin), the last value is kept as initial, and new values are added to it. For instance, a cumulative translation from 0 to 100 will, in first run, move the object from 0 to 100. On second repetition, the object will move from 100 to 200, and so on. This is particularly useful for creating continuous movement which should go forever.</p>
			</section>
			
			<section id="animation_types">
				<h2>Animation types</h2>
				<p>There are, for most intents and purposes, three basic animation types in SVG. <strong>Transformations</strong> change the element's <em>transform</em> attribute, allowing for rotation, translation, scaling, and skewing. <strong>Motion along path</strong> is similar, and as name implies, moves the element along a given path. <strong>Attribute animation</strong> is the widest and most generic type of animation, which allows for the change of almost any remaining attribute of almost any SVG element.</p>
					<section id="animation_types_transform_translate">
						<h3>Translation</h3>
						<p>Movement along X and Y axis. Each keyframe is defined by two values indicating the element's position. The node interface allows the user to set each by hand. Holding <em>ctrl</em> while dragging a node will move it in straight line from previous node to current node's last position.</p>
					</section>
			
					<section id="animation_types_transform_rotate">
						<h3>Rotation</h3>
						<p>Turning around a given origin. Keyframes hold angle (in degrees) and the X and Y position of the origin. The position of origin can change throughout the animation, allowing for fairly complex range of motion (albeit harder to master than simply turning along a single point). Node interface allows the user to move all origins with the same location, and all handles.</p>
						<p>For each origin, angle zero is given as the angle the line from the origin to the affected element.</p>
					</section>
			
					<section id="animation_types_transform_scale">
						<h3>Scaling</h3>
						<p>Changing the element's size. Described by scale factor in X and Y axis (allows independent scaling). As SVG has no native support for scaling origin, aniGen provides a more-or-less functional workaround.</p>
					</section>
			
					<section id="animation_types_transform_skew">
						<h3>Skewing</h3>
						<p>Separated into horizontal (X axis) and vertical (Y axis) skew animations. Each keyframe is defined by the skew angle, zero being the initial value.</p>
					</section>
			
					<section id="animation_types_motion">
						<h3>Motion through path</h3>
						<p>Has the element travel along a given path. Optionally, the <em>angle</em> can be set (or set to <em>auto</em> or <em>auto-reverse</em>) this will turn the element as it travels along the path instead of simply translating it.</p>
					</section>
			
					<section id="animation_types_attribute">
						<h3>Attribute animation</h3>
						<p>Changes the selected attribute of the parent (except <em>transform</em> and several other attributes) through time. Each value indicates the new value. Several attributes (display, visibility, opacity) allow the user to select values from available presets.</p>
						<p>If keyframes are selected in the keyframes window, the <a href="#tools_picker">picker tool</a> can be used to pick values of other (clicked) elements with relative ease.</p>
					</section>
				
			</section>
			
			<section id="animation_groups">
				<h2>Animation groups</h2>
					<p>AniGen expands the basic animation functionality by introducing animated groups (or animation groups).</p>
					<p>The user can select any element (or group thereof) and save it as an <em>animation state</em>. States are grouped according to the number and order of elements, so that standard path animation is applicable between all of them. When created, animation group allows the user to set each state from the group as the value of given keyframes. This allows the user to quickly change one complex shape to another without the need to create and synchronize large number of attribute animations.</p>
					<section id="animation_groups_state">
						<h3>Animation state</h3>
						<p>Animation states are set by selecting an object, and chosing object -> object to animation state from the main menu. When selected, the user will be able to pick a name for the given state, as well as the group. If no group exists, or no group shares the element model necessary, the user will have to pick the <em>New group</em> option and naming the group.</p>
						
						<p><strong>Note:</strong> if a group is made into a state, its transformation is disregarded. This means one can duplicate a group, move it somewhere else, and tweak elements therein without fear of making the final animation travel the distance.</p>

						<h3>Animated group</h3>
						<p>Group animations behave like any other. They have duration, begins, times, and so on. Each value is denoted with the state name the user has given, as well as a small visual preview.</p>
						<p>At current stage, only paths shapes are animated between states. The initial state, including the fill and stroke colors of each element, is defined by the first state in any given group, i.e. the first element made into a state.</p>
